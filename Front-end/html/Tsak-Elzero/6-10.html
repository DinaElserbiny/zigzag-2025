<!-- Type Question 2 Answer Below

<!-- Type Question 3 Answer Below 
"it is not correct to use more than one <h1> on a page. In older HTML versions, <h1> is meant to represent
the primary heading of the entire page, so multiple <h1> tags
 could confuse browsers and affect accessibility or SEO"
-->

<!-- Type Question 4 Answer Below
"No, it does not make sense.
Headings should follow a logical hierarchy. 
Since the product title is in <h3>, placing an <h2> (which is higher in the hierarchy) 
inside the same item would disrupt the logical flow of headings"
 -->

<!-- 
Type Question 5 Answer Below 
"h1>: The most important heading (usually the main title of the page).
<h2>: A subheading of <h1>.
<h3>: A subheading of <h2>.
<h4>: A subheading of <h3>.
<h5>: A subheading of <h4>.
<h6>: The least important heading, a subheading of <h5>.
They are used to organize content and improve both readability and accessibility."

1. `<p class="element">Welcome To The New World</p>`  
   This is the correct and most commonly used way to define a class in HTML. It uses double quotes around the class name.

2. `<p class='element'>Welcome To The New World</p>`  
   This is also correct. You can use single quotes for the class name as long as they are balanced and properly placed.

3. `<p class=element>Welcome To The New World</p>`  
   This is **incorrect**. The class name should be enclosed in quotes (either single or double). Without quotes, it will not be interpreted correctly by the browser.

<p class=element hidden>Welcome To The New World</p>
This is technically valid, but incorrectly formatted. The hidden attribute is a boolean attribute, and in HTML5, it can be used without a value. However, for clarity and consistency, it's recommended to always use quotes around the attribute values.

<p class="element" hidden>Welcome To The New World</p>
This is the correct and preferred way. It includes the class attribute with quotes around its
 value and uses the hidden attribute properly.
